<p>A banana is an edible fruit &ndash; botanically a berry &ndash; produced by several kinds</p>

<p>of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called &quot;plantains&quot;,</p>

<p>distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,</p>

<p>and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in</p>

<p>starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown</p>

<p>when ripe.</p>

<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in</p>

<p>the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,</p>

<p>Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of</p>

<p>years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European</p>

<p>colonists.</p>
